<h1>Personal Information </h1>

<p>Liam Hackett 
Student number - S3574031 
Email - liam.hackett1987@gmail.com
</p>
<p>Currently living in Sydney in the Northern Beaches with my partner and my dog. I’m working full-time managing a Gym and studying on the side. My current degree is a Bachelor of Business (Logistics and Supply Chain Management. I was working in the Supply Chain/Logistics field, focusing on Purchasing and Procurement before I took my newest role. My partner is from Brazil so I am learning Portuguese on the side when I find the time. </p>

<h1>Interest in IT </h1>

<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).  </h3>

<p>I’ve always had an interest in IT, however, I was extremely intimidated by the field as I thought I would never be smart or technical enough to undertake and courses or classes. I was always fascinated by technological advances that were an environmentally friendly or health conscious, such as electric cars/boats, apps such as word, slides in conjunction with Drop-box/Google drive to help store documents and save on paper, Health apps that monitor steps and vital body signs. I’ve also been fascinated with the working of apps and with the help of my partner who is a senior software engineer, I have been able to gain some insight in to the lines of code that help make these apps work. My IT experience is fairly minimal outside of the things that my partner has shown me. I want to be able to create my own apps on a consistent basis. </p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 
 </h3>
 <p>The main reason was that it coincided with my study really well. As mentioned I am already currently studying through RMIT and these IT units that I will be undertaking will be a seamless transition for me as I already know the RMIT Canvas layout. My father also was a student of RMIT when he was younger and I thought it would be a cool concept to have something tied back to my family with regard to higher learning.</p>

<h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p> I believe that on the technical side of things that I will learn the basics and fundamentals of both software and hardware pertaining to the IT field. I think there will be a good cover on learning to code, which I am looking forward to, as I want to expand my knowledge on HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript along with Swift and Java. I believe I will increase my teamwork skills, as it seems a lot of the studies relating to both the IT and my current degree are teamwork based.</p>

<h3>	A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. 
 </h3>

<p>Working for a Government agency always has been a highlight to me as I always thought that working for the Government would have a direct impact on the people of Australia, meaning I would take a lot of pride in my work. The job to me looks as a developer for an app for the NSW Government, going over creating and testing and submitting to market. Also, a major part will be coming up with new ideas to create and implement the app. </p3>

<h3>	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.  </h3>

<p> I would need to be well versed in software engineering and using code languages to create and update the app. Working in a team environment with other engineers meaning I would need to know good communication and teamwork skills. I believe that the experience for this position would be somewhere from 5-10 years in the field with a degree in IT and good knowledge of multiple coding languages. </p>

<h3>	A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. 
 </h3>

<p>My communication and teamwork skills have been built over many years working in Logistic and Supply Chain environments. Communication was key as I was a vital part in the process of having products delivered on time in full. I had to work with multiple team members during these processes meaning that my experience in this area is well developed. I also have introduction to HTML and JavaScript languages. Now, this is nowhere on the level of the job advertisement itself, however, I have put my foot in the door and I am gaining a basic understanding of what the job would entail.  </p>

<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can. </h3>

<p>I have already started trying to obtain the skills as I have been attending coding days with my partner in the Sydney CBD. These are all-day classes that teach coding mainly in HTML or JavaScript languages at different levels of experience with the language. I also have taken personal study via textbooks from the local library with books on Python whilst enrolling myself in Codecademy and CodeCamp websites to help check my code input. I am continuing with Tertiary education via a degree through RMIT and hope that this along with all my personal learning will help get a foot in the door for either a graduate/entry level role or even internship whilst I am still studying. If I can get into a beginner role then my experience and skills will shoot up exponentially. If I keep at this for the next 5-7 years I believe I can get into something very similar to the job posting. </p>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>

<p> I think these test results show me that, I try to engage with people in a social setting, try to take control of a project, and help out people where I can. I believe it also states that I can be helpful in a team situation and I show boldness to get in and try everything. I am not afraid of social situations, however, I do enjoy time to myself. It helps to be in a group to get things done as I learn from other people instead of reading about it</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>

<p> I think it will be a positive impact for the team, as I will help get tasks done and wont shy away from any tasks that arise. I will make sure I get the portion of my assessments and group work done on time and will ask for help if I can’t get the right answer so as to make sure we can attain the highest marks possible as a team.</p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>

<p>	I think that as long as I have people on the team that are willing to communicate openly I’ll be fine. I rely on people keeping me up-to-date with project work and don’t want to be left taking the mass of the workload. I take this into account when meeting people for the group project and try and get like minded individuals. </p>


<h3>Overview </h3>

<p>The idea is to implement charge stations for electric and solar powered cross-country high-speed trains throughout Australia. The project would look at costs associated with implementing locomotives with solar paneling and electricity charging capabilities as to supersede diesel locomotives. This is to service both the East Coast and West Coast of Australia with connections at major centres to connect West with East and North with South parts of Australia. The aim will be to reduce cost and travel times between major ports and centres inside Australia. </p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The motivation behind this idea falls under a number of categories. The first being that Australia’s size is so significant that getting around via car/bus driven highways can take an extremely long time. With high-speed rail networks you can traverse cross-country in half the time in a safer environment. This is especially handy for people going away for work who can spend time on the train with a project whilst travelling.
Another factor taken into account is the amount of environmental impact that this would have positively. This would supersede diesel locomotives and reduce carbon emissions. There is a reduction in about 20-30% of carbon dioxide when switching from diesel to electric. The last factor would be cost reduction on local, state and federal governments. The cost to run an electric train is cheaper due to being lighter on tracks. This means less track maintenance is needed from constant wear and tear and electric trains will never need to carry fuel as it’s supplied to the engine constantly via charging stations.
 </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> The basic model of the charging station will take after earlier designs of charging stations that are currently in place for electric cars. Currently with the amount of cost, environmentally impactful and time consumption relating to transport in Australia, high-speed electric trains can tear down barriers that we didn’t think were possible. By implementing state of the art charge stations at pivotal points around Australia, we can set up a interlinking network of electric trains that will supply travellers with an environmentally, safe, quick and cost efficient mode of transportation.  As it stands now, cars have one port that receives a charge via a charging cable at a station. The car has to remain in one position whilst the charge happens and this can take anywhere between 30 minutes to 12 hours. With an introduction of high-tech charging ports, you will be able to charge a train at a destination like Sydney within 1-2 hours and set off to Melbourne and arrive within 3-5 hours. This means that once a train arrives at its destination (if it doesn’t have enough charge) it can effectively charge within a feasible time frame and make a 1000km journey via land within 3-4 hours. There will be no traffic as there would be with cars and no customs and airport wait times like there currently is with airports. This will also move away from the trend of overhead power lines that are currently in place for currently electric trains. Meaning less infrastructure cost for new trains and less chance of a malfunction and maintenance on power lines needed to charge the current model of electric transport.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

<p> The tools needed to implement this model and move away from both traditional over-head power-lines and diesel engines will be charging stations similar to what is used for electric cars currently. This would mean infrastructure would need to be set-up in major cities at stations and at each station along the route with some stand-alone charging ports. As we already have these processes in place, all we would need to do is scale up to meet the demand of a train sized charging area as opposed to one for a car.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>

<p>The software required will be computer systems at charging ports at each station to determine the power that a train has left and how much further it can accomplish on it’s journey. You will need qualified drivers for the trains, engineers to plan and implement the trains, carriages and tracks and you will need developers to oversee software onboard the train which will be entirely electronic. The computer system, brakes, power even GPS will all be centrally controlled via onboard software. The hardware itself will be the charging stations. Feasibly it’s possible, however, the costs would be high. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>If the project is successful that will mean that multiple entities will be used in construction of new rail lines, charging stations and local economic boosts from more visitors throughout these centres. It will allow people to travel in a much more environmentally friendly way throughout Australia, with quieter and faster trains and at a cheaper cost than what is currently being provided in Australia. It will increase another travel option to get around instead of driving or flying and will offer people a greater chance to explore this country.  The main problem will be conversion of old rail lines to support new electric trains which could be costly and implementation of completely new lines where there weren’t any before. Bodies that support diesel and diesel locomotives, as they will be directly affected financially, will oppose it. They will try to slow or stop the growth of this new trend of electric powered transport. </p>
